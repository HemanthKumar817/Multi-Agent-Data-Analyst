# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-Agent Data Analyst

The **Multi-Agent Data Analyst** is an intelligent system that uses multiple AI agents working collaboratively to analyze, interpret, and visualize datasets. Instead of relying on a single model, this project leverages specialized agents that communicate with each other to provide insights, generate queries, and create reports—making data analysis more accurate, automated, and scalable.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – Different agents (Query Agent, Analysis Agent, Visualization Agent) work together.  
- 📊 **Automated Data Analysis** – Upload your dataset and let agents generate insights.  
- 🔎 **Natural Language Queries** – Ask questions in plain English, and the system translates them into SQL or Pandas queries.  
- 📈 **Visualization Support** – Automatically generates charts/graphs for better understanding.  
- 📂 **Extensible Design** – Easily add more agents for custom tasks (e.g., predictive modeling, anomaly detection).
